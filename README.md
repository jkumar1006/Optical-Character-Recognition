📸 AI-Powered Image Processing & Content Extraction

🌟 Overview

This project automates image processing and content extraction using a state-of-the-art generative AI model. The system is designed to handle bulk image transformation, extract meaningful insights, and store results in an organized format such as an Excel file. It ensures efficient data management, error handling, and structured output generation.

🚀 Features

✅ Batch Image Processing – Handles multiple images at once.

✅ AI-Driven Content Extraction – Uses generative AI to analyze and extract key insights from images.

✅ Automated Workflow – Preprocessing, AI model interaction, postprocessing, and structured response handling.

✅ Error Handling System – Detects and logs issues in processing while maintaining workflow efficiency.

✅ Structured Data Storage – Saves extracted information in Excel format for easy analysis.

✅ User-Friendly Pipeline – Ensures smooth image-to-data transformation.

🏗️ Architecture & Methodology

1️⃣ Input Layer – Collects unprocessed images from a local directory.

2️⃣ Processing Layer – Performs preprocessing, AI-based content extraction, and data structuring.

3️⃣ Postprocessing – Cleans AI-generated responses and converts them into a structured format (JSON, text).

4️⃣ Output Layer – Saves extracted content and transformed images in Excel and organized folders.

5️⃣ Error Handling – Logs and handles failures in processing to ensure system robustness.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

AI Model: Google Generative AI API

Image Processing: Pillow, OpenCV

Data Storage: Pandas, Excel (.xlsx)

Error Logging: Python Logging Module

🔄 How It Works

1️⃣ Load images from the input directory.
